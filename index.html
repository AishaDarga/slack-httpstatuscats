    <h2>About HTTP Status Cats</h2>

    <p>Internet is made of cats, so why not HTTP Status codes, explained with cats?</p>
    <p>Originally, HTTP Status Cats was created by yours truly, <em>me</em> in 2011! It is best described on <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/http-status-cats" target="_blank">Know Your Meme</a>.</p>
    <p>I would never imagined I had such a 10-min fame at that time I created and posted the cat pics on Flickr.
      I was immediately featured on Boing Boing, Mashables, CNN Tech, BuzzFeed, and many more including international tech news etc.
      Especially, I loved that <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/12/14/http-status-cats-by-girliemac.html" target="_blank">Boing Boing</a> said I "just won the internet".

    <p>A good time.</p>

    <p>HTTP Status Cats are later well-adopted by communities,
      and evolved into many APIs and apps,
      especially HTTP Status Cats API and its awesome domain, <strong>http.cat</strong> by Rog√©rio Vicente.
      The page is also available in Catalan language, as its TLD shows!
